GIT WORKFLOW

In our workflow, we have one main branch - MASTER

If you need to add some changes to the project, you should push them to your own branch and send me a pull request, so that I can merge the changes you've made to the master branch.

Step-by-step ONLY FOR THE FIRST TIME:

1. Clone the repository:  git clone https://github.com/tech-soldier/e-commerce.git

2. Create your own branch you will be working on: git checkout -b dawnbranch 

3. After you've made changes:

 	git add .

 	git commit -m "commit message"

 	git push --set-upstream origin dawnbranch 

4. Go to github repository -> create pull request from your branch to master branch

5. Inna confirms pull request -> master branch is updated

6. Go back to your local master branch: git checkout master

7. Pull changes from remote master to local master: git pull
